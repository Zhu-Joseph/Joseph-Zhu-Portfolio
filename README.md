# Joseph-Zhu-Portfolio
An update on my original portfolio

This project is show people what I can do and what I have learned with my HTML and CSS.
I utilize flexboxes so that the website can adjust with screen sizes.

Also the portfolio page is a way for people to get to know me a bit better.
I hope that it provides helpful information about who I am and my interest in software engineering.
