          <h1>Hi I'm Joseph Zhu</h1>
          <p>I graduated from UCLA in 2016 with a career lined up as a tax accountant. My hope was to help guide people towards financial freedom, specifically through helping people with their taxes. However, as I was working in tax, I eventually realized that building better and more accessible software was going to reach more people than a single CPA could.</p>

          <p>Being a CPA located in Los Angeles, I have the background and knowledge of what professionals and the average Joe are looking for. They want something simple, easy to use and accurate in order to bring them confidence for their financial situation.</p>

          <p> I am a strong believer in the fact that Tech is here to stay. Things like the internet and its endless source of knowledge can really help better everyone's livelihoods. Which is why I am excited to work with other programmers to develop awesome projects and continue to progress human flourishing. More specifically, my skill set consist of Javascript, HTML & CSS, and bit of Python.</p>
